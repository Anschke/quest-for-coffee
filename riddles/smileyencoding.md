# Smiling at History

In this corner of the room, a display with four windows is open. As you come closer, your perception is captured by a list of ancient runes
from *way* before the Age of Stars displayed in one of the windows.

Another window appears to contain a wall of text someone left open.

<code>
When I woke up that morning, I stubbed my toe - what a start, let me tell you.
Looking back, it was probably a sign, but I weren't to pick up on that until much later.
As I made my way to the cafeteria, I noticed Ensign Guybrush carrying around a tube of torque grease.
But I have told Traynor again and again that she needs to fix her security.
As I arrived, I got jumped by someone from accounting.
Apparently, someone didn't order any java - like, at all!
Now, we have a average consumption of 4 packages per tenday, leaving us with reserves that will last about 3,5 weeks which with monthly
supply runs is a problem.
What am I supposed to do there?
Should I go to the quarter master and complain that someone failed to order the single-most important substance?
Last time I did, I got written up - not doing that again.

The third window contains a display, showing the following content:

<p><code>Your decoded password is: <div id="output"></div></code></p>

The fourth and final window shows a prompt, waiting for something. On the side of the monitor, close to this window,
someone has tucked on a note:

> Readable text password, no inappropriate words. Stick to the guidelines, Frank!

<details><summary>Task</summary>
When you are certain that the correct password has been unscrambled, add it behind the `8:`.
</details>

<div class="key">
8: ""
</div>
