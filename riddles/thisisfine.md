# A New Rug?

Recently, a new rug was installed in this room. Somewhat hidden in a side compartment is a feedback box containing 14 slips.
A message is shown on a nearby display.

> Dear Sector [replace this part with your sector designation] team, we are taking our responsibility for your well-being very serious!
> Therefore, we have introduced a line of calming and relaxing elements for your daily pleasure, so you can be your best selves while you
> [replace this with something your sector does to show care and knowledge about their day-to-day]. We are therefore proud to present you
> with the Rug of Relaxation! Enjoy your daily alloted timeslot of leisure time while you walk it barefoot (don't forget to clean!) and
> think about that feeling. If you have found a way to put it into words, put text on a note and commit it into the Feedback Box of Heardness.
> Should you come across collegues who have negative feedback, make sure to inform your supervisor so that we can solve that problem together!

Someone has pinned a note below:

> Just spend 2 hours trying to figure this thing out. Only lowercase, no spaces, no special characters. You're welcome. Signed, Eng. McTornister
