We honor equal Open-Source distributions, so make sure your additions are not too one-sided.

Research told us that a good balance can be found, when everyone reach out with at least 2 contributions.
And also a project is more efficient when having at least 4 contributors, that will also keep the bus factor low.

We are also doing that here ... or ... do we?
