# Hangman

Flickering monitors in this room present you with a running game of hangman. Someone has left a notepad behind. On it, you read:

```md
This is the sixth time I had to replace my torque grease because SOME PEOPLE have no manners, apparently. Stop stealing my stuff! Yes, it looks like strawberry yoghurt. Yes, the ingredients state 69% strawberry content, but the rest is mineral oil. No, you can't eat it.

I am sick and tired of you people eating my utility materials! So here's the deal: if you are smart enough to figure out my challenge, you may have access to my room. Take what you need then. For everyone else: should you fail to finish the game by winning, the monitoring system will start recording you. You are warned!

Addendum: after numerous complaints, I have disabled the recording, and I have been told to clarify that destroying cameras with chewing gum, hammers, laser pistols or by soaking them in mate is a offense according to Federal Galactic Regulation and can be punished. So no recording. But you still can't have my stuff without winning the game.

Second addendum: I have confiscated one of the keys for the escape pods. You can have it back when Guybrush returns my torque grease. Anyone who helps Guybrush win the game again will be reported. That guy steals everything that isn't welded on or nailed down.
```

In one terminal to your right you also notice a blinking cursor with the prompt `Passwort for Eng. Traynors' room:`. Someone has removed both
the shift and capslock keys, so that will probably not be used.
