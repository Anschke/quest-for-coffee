# Stuck in a loop

As you enter the room, your eyes are drawn to a display repeating the same video file over and over again. The video is windowed, and both
title and description can be read.
On a notepad, several numbers have been jotted down and crossed out.

In one terminal to your right you also notice the following text.

`Video file found at`
[/mnt/drone_1338_discovery/Recording/Q0432_VDiv_Iye.mp4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZC5rHMvkwo)

`Count:`

A blinking cursor awaits a numeric input.

Input your value after `16:`.

<div class="key">
16: ""
</div>
