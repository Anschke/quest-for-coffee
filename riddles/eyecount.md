# Stuck in a loop

As you enter the room, your eyes are drawn to a display repeating the same video file over and over again. The video is in fullscreen mode.
On a notepad, several numbers have been jotted down and crossed out.

In one terminal to your right you also notice a blinking cursor: `Count:` and a numeric input.

Input your value after `15:`.

<div class="key">
15: ""
