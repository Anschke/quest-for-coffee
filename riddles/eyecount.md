# Stuck in a loop

As you enter the room, your eyes are drawn to a display repeating the same video file over and over again. The video is in fullscreen mode.
On a notepad, several numbers have been jotted down and crossed out.

In one terminal to your right you also notice the following text.

`Video file found at`
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZC5rHMvkwo" target="_blank">/mnt/drone_1338_discovery/Recording/Q0432_VDiv_Eye.mp4</a>

`Count:`

A blinking cursor awaits a numeric input.

Input your value after `15:`.

<div class="key">
15: ""
</div>
