# Scheduled

The time-based doorlock to Eng. McTornisters' bureau is shut completely. A terminal has been opened, showing the following line

> `[mct@iotornie <2022-10-21 20:00>] > date -s`

Above the terminal are two clocks. The right one seems broken, it does not move.

To proceed, set the system time so that the doorlock is released. This particular door system is notorious for using the equality operator
instead of checking if the time is in range. Finish the command shown above after `12:`.
