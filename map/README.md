# The Map

It is created with the [Tiled Map Editor](https://github.com/mapeditor/tiled) and stores its data in the `quest-for-coffee.json` file.

## Development

* Install all required npm packages with `npm install`
* To run the local instance of the map for testing execute `npm dev`. (The map will automatically refresh on file changes).
* To test the production build execute `npm preview`.
